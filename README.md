# discussion-forum
Discussion forum that implements SpringSecurity and Redux.

This time-consuming project was made possible by several youtube tutorials such as Java Brains, Amigoscode, CodeEveolution, Promming wih Mosh, Shaggyer, etc. Big thanks to them all. I am not the orignal author of some of the hard-coded configurations and some of the coding layouts. The end-product looks quiet minimal but there are actually a lot of planning and writing the React components specified for their own tasks. The SpringBoot configurations are also rough to set up and debug. I learned about REST APIs, SpringSecurty, JWT as well as the design of Redux and its containers.
